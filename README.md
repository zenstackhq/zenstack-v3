# What's ZenStack

ZenStack is a TypeScript database toolkit for developing full-stack or backend Node.js/Bun applications. It provides a unified data modeling and access solution with the following features:

- A modern schema-first ORM that's compatible with [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma)'s schema and API
- Versatile data access APIs: high-level (Prisma-style) ORM queries + low-level ([Kysely](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely)) query builder
- Built-in access control and data validation (coming soon)
- Advanced data modeling patterns like [polymorphism](https://zenstack.dev/blog/polymorphism)
- Designed for extensibility and flexibility: plugins, life-cycle hooks, etc.
- Automatic CRUD web APIs with adapters for popular frameworks (coming soon)
- Automatic [TanStack Query](https://github.com/TanStack/query) hooks for easy CRUD from the frontend (coming soon)

# What's new with V3

ZenStack V3 is a major rewrite of [V2](https://github.com/zenstackhq/zenstack). The biggest change is V3 doesn't have a runtime dependency to Prisma anymore. Instead of working as a big wrapper of Prisma as in V2, V3 made a bold move and implemented the entire ORM engine using [Kysely](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely), while keeping the query API fully compatible with Prisma.

Please check [this blog post](https://zenstack.dev/blog/next-chapter-1) for why we made this big architectural change decision.

Even without using advanced features, ZenStack offers the following benefits as a drop-in replacement to Prisma:

1. Pure TypeScript implementation without any Rust/WASM components.
2. More TypeScript type inference, less code generation.
3. Fully-typed query-builder API as a better escape hatch compared to Prisma's [raw queries](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/using-raw-sql/raw-queries) or [typed SQL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/using-raw-sql/typedsql).

> Although ZenStack v3's ORM runtime doesn't depend on Prisma anymore (specifically, `@prisma/client`), it still relies on Prisma to handle database migration. See [database migration](https://zenstack.dev/docs/3.x/orm/migration) for more details.

# Quick start

> You can also check the [blog sample](./samples/blog) for a complete example.

## Installation

### 1. Creating a new project

Use the following command to scaffold a simple TypeScript command line application with ZenStack configured:

```bash
npm create zenstack@next my-project
```

### 2. Setting up an existing project

Or, if you have an existing project, use the CLI to initialize it:

```bash
npx @zenstackhq/cli@next init
```

### 3. Manual setup

Alternatively, you can set it up manually:

```bash
npm install -D @zenstackhq/cli@next
npm install @zenstackhq/orm@next
```

Then create a `zenstack` folder and a `schema.zmodel` file in it.
